# Advent of Code: 2020

My Rust solutions to Advent of Code 2020. This was started in late
2021 and serves as an opportunity for me to learn and have fun with
Rust.

## Miscellaneous Notes

 - I'm having a lot of fun with ierators and closures!
 - The `solve` functions return `i32`s, and it feels like *maybe* that
   was a bad choice??
 - There could definitely be more error checking going on, but that
   isn't really my focus with this project.
 - The modularization of the code is working for me right now, but I
   do often wonder if this choice will begin to have its downsides and
   what a more experienced Rustacean would do.
